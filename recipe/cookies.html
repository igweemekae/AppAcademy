    <h3>Description</h2>
        <p>Gingersnap Cookies is grandma's favourite for kids. This melt-in-your-mouth ginger cookie recipe that I received from my grandmother has been enjoyed in my family since 1899.</p>
        <p>Gingersnap cookies are perfect for munching, on cookies trays, or made into a crumb pie crust.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups sifted all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon salt</li>
            <li><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup shortening</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup dark molasses</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup cinnamon sugar</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
        </ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Sift flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt into a mixing bowl. Stir the mixture until blended, then sift a second time into another bowl.</li>
            <li>Place shortening in a mixing bowl and beat until creamy. Gradually mix in white sugar. Beat in egg and dark molasses until light and fluffy. Sift 1/3 of the flour mixture into the shortening mixture; stir to thoroughly blend. Sift in the remaining flour mixture and mix together until a soft dough forms.</li>
            <li>Pinch off small amounts of dough and roll them into 1-inch-diameter balls between your hands. Roll each ball in cinnamon sugar, then place 2-inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops are rounded and slightly cracked, about 10 minutes. Cool cookies on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container.</li>
        </ol>
